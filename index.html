        		<h1>Nicolas Loy Rodas - Personal Webpage</h1>
          <p> PhD in Medical Robotics with 4 years of experience in object-oriented software development using C++ for Computer Vision, Augmented Reality and Robotics applications (OpenCV, PCL, VTK and Qt) and in GPU programming using CUDA.<p> 

	<p>During my PhD, I led the development of a radiation awareness system for improving the monitoring of ionizing radiation during X-ray guided medical procedures. My work has led to two patent applications, several publications in scientific journals/conferences and to the development of a prototype system installed and demonstrated in an operating room. <p>

	<p>Fluent in three languages, I possess a multicultural background, which has enabled me to develop great communication skills, along with a capability to quickly adapt to new environments. <p>
